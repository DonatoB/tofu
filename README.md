### How to build
```bash
# Go to your development directory
cd ~/git/
# Clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:donato/tofu.git
cd tofu

# Install dependencies
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install

# Run build
grunt
```	

The build script will test your code for some common mistakes, and then build a new tofu-min.user.js in the /bin/ folder for you to test!
